# Texture Mapping, Object Loading and Animation
Texture Mapping:

point 1 and 2

My part was focused on integration the robotic body completed in task 2 and adding a floor to it as well as
adding a texture to the floor. The code in the texture tutorial was very useful for me because i had errors adding the texture by
my own without the help of the tutorial's code. I added the code from the tutorial and added my part of the robotic body and it
worked perfectly. I had to change some pushes and pops and edit some of the code but it worked out in the end as i was
able to add the textured floor and on top of it the robot.

We started by adding the given files in tutorial 5 (glm.h,glm.cpp,main.cpp) for object loading then we implemented the robotic body we did in Assignment 2 inside the main file. We faced some errors while merging both codes together but we figured it out and solved the erros successfully. After that we downloaded some 3D models from (www.seethome3d.com) added them to the data folder inside Assignment 3 folder then we added their names to the attached screen menue where every object has a different case then we scaled them to the robotic body to look more realistic, one of the problems we faced in this part is that every object has a different size so we had to scale them individually.Lastly but not least we did the animations using the timer function and some poses and setters.
